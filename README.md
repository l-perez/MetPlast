# MetPlast
 
MetPlast is an R-package that integrates functions that allows to calculate several parameters associated with Metabolic Plasticity using Information Theory as an statistical framework. 
 
MetPlast consolidates some of the latest research in Plant Computational Metabolism, providing valuable computational tools to quickly evaluate several paramenters such as metabolic diversity (MetPlast()), metabolome specialization (MetSpec), and metabolite specialization (MetliteSpec()). 
 
MetPlast is being continuosly updated. Thus, new functionalities, mostly related with visualization, will be added soon. Please, take into account that even though this package was settle using metabolic data, the same functions can be use to evaluate transcriptomic data.

A comprehensive tutorial can be found in the main coding page at GitHub in three independent formats: (1) Rmd, (2) .html, (3) .pdf
